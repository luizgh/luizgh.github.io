I am an **R&D Scientist** at **Ubisoft La Forge**, conducting research at the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and computer graphics. At La Forge, my work focuses on developing advanced methods for **face capture** and **facial animation** specifically tailored for **video game applications**.

My interests include **capture systems** and **generative models for controllable and disentangled animation**, aimed at advancing character technology for real-time applications. I am passionate about conducting applied research that addresses real-world production challenges â€“ identifying problems, developing novel techniques, and seeing these integrated into tools and pipelines that facilitate more realistic and controllable facial animation.

I supervise students during their research internships in these exciting fields. We are often searching for motivated PhD students looking to contribute to cutting-edge projects in facial animation, capture systems, and generative models.
